    Great question! The idea is for people to enter some of their favorite bands
    into a database. The app will search by proximity (say 50 miles), and find
    other people in your area who are into the same type of music.

    The cool part is you two can chat, and bond over the music you love.
    The rest is up to you. Go to concerts, share music, form a band.
